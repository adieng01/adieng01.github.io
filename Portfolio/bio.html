			<h1>Hi.</h1>
			<div id="bio">
				<p>My name's Amina. As a New York native living in Boston, I always make a point to walk extremely fast and ignore the Knicks when I can. I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts studying English and Computer Science. While at school, I split my time between academics, telling jokes in an all-WoC comedy group, writing for a literary magazine, and cooking soup.

				<p>I'm a cat person, but having a cat is logistically impossible for me at this time so I have many parakeets instead. I also watch more docuseries than you do.</p>
